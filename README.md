This is an Enotes_System project where you can take notes and save in one place and this makes it easier for you go to back and read the notes you have taken. It will go with you everywhere since it is online.

**I'm using Visual Studio Code to make this project**

To run this program, you will have to use some commands:
First you have to make sure that you have python installed into your computer in order to run the following code: "pip install django" .
other installed programs are in the 'requirements.txt' file

Last step:
To run this project, you will have to type "python manage.py runserver" in the terminal.

Enjoy!
